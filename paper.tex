The COVID-19 pandemic in Spain is part of the pandemic of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first confirmed to have spread to Spain on
31 January 2020, when a German tourist tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in
La Gomera, Canary Islands. Post-hoc genetic analysis has shown that at least
15 strains of the virus had been imported, and community transmission began by
mid-February. By 13 March, cases had been confirmed in all 50 provinces of the country.

A lockdown was imposed on 14 March 2020. On 29 March, it was announced that,
beginning the following day, all non-essential workers were ordered to remain at
home for the next 14 days. By late March, the Community of Madrid has recorded
the most cases and deaths in the country. Medical professionals and those who
live in retirement homes have experienced especially high infection rates. On
25 March, the official death toll in Spain surpassed that of mainland China.
On 2 April, 950 people died of the virus in a 24-hour periodâ€”at the time, the
most by any country in a single day. On 17 May, the daily death toll announced
by the Spanish government fell below 100 for the first time, and 1 June was the
first day without deaths by COVID-19. The state of alarm ended on 21 June.

\section*{Data}

This paper uses data from \texttt{Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset} \autocite{owid-covid-data}.

The period chosen is April 1 to April 30 2020. Table \ref{table:1} gives some samples from that period.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c| }
  \hline
  \textbf{Date} & \textbf{Total number death cases} \\
  \hline
  April 1 2020 & 9387 \\
  April 2 2020 & 10348 \\
  April 3 2020 & 11198 \\
  April 4 2020 & 11947 \\
  April 5 2020 & 12641 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Total number of COVID-19 death cases in Spain from April 1 to April 5 2020.}
\label{table:1}
\end{table}

\section*{Model}

Let $P(t)$ be the total number of death cases $t$ days after April 1 2020.
The growth rate $\diff{P}{t}$, which represents daily new death cases,
is calculated using the formula:

\begin{align} \label{rate_formula}
\diff{P}{t}(t_i) =
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2.5}\left\{\begin{array}{@{}l@{\quad}l@{}}
  \dfrac{1}{2} \left [ P(t_{i + 1}) - P(t_{i - 1}) \right ] &\text{if } 0 < i < n \\
  P(t_{1}) - P(t_{0}) &\text{if } i = 0 \\
  P(t_{n}) - P(t_{n - 1}) &\text{if } i = n \\
\end{array}\right.\kern-\nulldelimiterspace
\end{align}

%Table \ref{table:2} gives sample values of $P$, $\diff{P}{t}$, and the relative growth rate $\frac{1}{P} \diff{P}{t}$.

For this paper, we use a variant of the Logistic Growth Model:

\begin{equation} \label{model_eqn}
\frac{1}{P} \diff{P}{t} = aP + b
\end{equation}

The coefficients $a$ and $b$ are determined using least squares polynomial fit:

\begin{align} \label{coef}
\begin{split}
a &= -4.827879002776788 \times 10^{-6} \\
b &= 0.12215521367938273
\end{split}
\end{align}

  function of $P$ (red points) and the best fitted line (blue).}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solving Differential Equation}

Equation \ref{model_eqn} is separable. We have:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\dl{P}}{P(aP + b)} = \dl{t}
\end{equation}

Integrate both sides;

\begin{equation} \label{int_eqn}
\int \frac{\dl{P}}{P(aP + b)} = \int \dl{t}
\end{equation}

To evaluate the integral on the left side, we use partial fraction decomposition:

\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{P(aP + b)} = \frac{X}{P} + \frac{Y}{aP + b}
\end{equation*}

Multiplying both sides of this equation by $P(aP + b)$ and rearranging the terms, we have:

\begin{equation*}
1 = (Xa + Y)P + Xb
\end{equation*}

The polynomials are identical, so their coefficients must be equal:

\begin{align*}
Xa + Y &= 0 \\
Xb &= 1
\end{align*}

We get $X = \dfrac{1}{b}$ and $Y = \dfrac{-a}{b}$. Therefore:

\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{P(aP + b)} = \frac{1}{b} \cdot \frac{1}{P} - \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{1}{aP + b}
\end{equation*}

We can now rewrite equation \ref{int_eqn} as:

\begin{align*}
\int \left ( \frac{1}{b} \cdot \frac{1}{P} - \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{1}{aP + b} \right ) \dl{P} &= \int \dl{t} \\
\frac{1}{b} \ln \abs{P} - \frac{1}{b} \ln \abs{aP + b} &= t + C \\
\ln \abs{\frac{P}{aP + b}} &= bt + bC \\
\abs{\frac{P}{aP + b}} &= e^{bt + bC} = e^{bt}e^{bC} \\
\frac{P}{aP + b} &= Ae^{bt} \numberthis \label{int2_eqn}
\end{align*}

where $A = \pm e^{bC}$. Solving for P, we get:

\begin{equation} \label{final_eqn}
P = \frac{bAe^{bt}}{1 - aAe^{bt}}
\end{equation}

The growth rate is:

\begin{equation} \label{final_rate_eqn}
\diff{P}{t} = \frac{b^2Ae^{bt}}{\left ( 1 - aAe^{bt} \right ) ^2}
\end{equation}

We find the value of A by putting $t = 0$ in equation \ref{int2_eqn}:

\begin{equation*}
A = \frac{P_0}{aP_0 + b}
\end{equation*}

Substituting coefficients from \ref{coef} and $P_0 = 9387$:

\begin{equation*}
A = 122169.433209181
\end{equation*}

\section*{Discussion}

This paper presents a simple logistic model for predicting COVID-19 fatality in Spain.
As showed in figure \ref{prediction}, the total number of death cases increased
exponentially in the early stages but began to level off at the end of April.
The model predicts that daily death cases would decrease significantly in May,
which indeed happened in reality. Therefore, the logistic model is a suitable
choice for predicting COVID-19 fatality.
